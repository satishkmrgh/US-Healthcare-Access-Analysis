# üè• US Healthcare Access Analysis

## üìò Overview
**US Healthcare Access Analysis** is a data-driven project focused on uncovering and visualizing **healthcare access disparities across U.S. states**.  
Using **Python** and advanced **data visualization** techniques, this project provides insights into the unequal distribution of healthcare resources and identifies gaps that can inform policy decisions and healthcare planning.

The analysis highlights variations in key healthcare indicators such as hospital availability, physician density, insurance coverage, and median income‚Äîhelping stakeholders and policymakers prioritize underserved regions.

## üéØ Objectives
- Assess disparities in healthcare access across different U.S. states.  
- Identify socioeconomic and demographic factors influencing healthcare availability.  
- Visualize access gaps using advanced Python data visualization libraries.  
- Present **actionable recommendations** for improving healthcare equity.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Map: Inequitable Access to Healthcare
Description:
This map highlights areas in the United States where social vulnerability overlaps with poor access to healthcare services.
The darker red regions represent counties with both high social vulnerability and low access to care, while blue regions indicate better healthcare accessibility.
The visualization exposes major access disparities concentrated in the Southern states, rural Midwest, and tribal communities across the West.
These findings emphasize systemic challenges such as geographic isolation, healthcare workforce shortages, and socioeconomic barriers that hinder equitable access to medical care.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Map: Share of Uninsured Residents (2022)
Description:
This map illustrates the percentage of uninsured residents under 65 across U.S. counties in 2022.
The darker blue areas indicate higher uninsured rates ‚Äî exceeding 15% in several Southern and Southwestern states, notably Texas, Florida, and parts of Georgia.
Nationally, the uninsured rate averaged 9.5%, but the regional variation reveals substantial coverage gaps, particularly in states that did not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.
This map supports the project‚Äôs conclusion that insurance coverage strongly influences healthcare access and affordability, reinforcing the need for policy-driven expansion of coverage programs.
